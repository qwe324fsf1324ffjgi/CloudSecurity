# 🔒 Cloud Security Scout

Cloud Security Scout is a lightweight, serverless AWS security monitoring tool built with AWS Lambda, DynamoDB, SES, and CloudFormation. It automatically scans your AWS environment for critical misconfigurations and sends email alerts to help maintain compliance with the CIS AWS Foundations Benchmark**.

## 🚀 Features

- Detects insecure security group rules (e.g., SSH/RDP open to the world).
- Flags unencrypted RDS instances.
- Stores findings in a DynamoDB table with timestamps.
- Sends automated email alerts using Amazon SES.
- Runs automatically every 6 minutes via EventBridge rule.
- Fully deployable with AWS CloudFormation.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* AWS Lambda (Python 3.9)
* Amazon EC2 (Security Group analysis)
* Amazon RDS (Encryption check)
* Amazon DynamoDB
* Amazon SES (Simple Email Service)
* AWS EventBridge (Scheduled execution)
* AWS CloudFormation (Infrastructure as Code)

---

## 📦 Deployment

> Prerequisites:
>
> * You must have a verified email in **Amazon SES** (in sandbox or production).
> * Upload your Lambda code as `index.zip` to the specified S3 bucket.

### Step 1: Package Your Lambda Function

```bash
zip -r index.zip index.py
aws s3 cp index.zip s3://your-bucket-name/
```

> Replace `your-bucket-name` in the template with the actual name.

### Step 2: Deploy CloudFormation Stack

```bash
aws cloudformation deploy \
  --template-file template.yaml \
  --stack-name CloudSecurityScout \
  --capabilities CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM
```

## 📩 Email Alerts

Alerts are sent from and to the following email (ensure it's verified in SES):

* **Sender/Recipient:** `zerahabba1@gmail.com`

Each alert includes:

* Type of finding
* Affected resource
* Specific details

---

## 📊 Findings Stored in DynamoDB

Table: `CloudSecurityFindings`

Each item includes:

* `id`: Combination of finding type and resource
* `timestamp`: ISO-formatted UTC time
* `type`, `resource`, `details`

---

## ✅ CIS AWS Foundations Benchmark Coverage

This tool helps monitor for:

* **1.1** Avoid use of root account (indirect support via security group hardening)
* **4.1-4.3** Ensure RDS instances are encrypted
* **4.4-4.5** Security group auditing for restricted ports

---

## 📌 Note

* S3 bucket findings were **intentionally excluded** in this version.
* Ensure IAM roles and policies are correctly applied for Lambda execution.
* Run frequency is customizable via the `ScheduleExpression` in the EventBridge rule.

---

## 📤 Outputs

Upon deployment, CloudFormation outputs:

* Lambda function ARN
* DynamoDB table name
* SES notification configuration
